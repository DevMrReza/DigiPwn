# 🔐 Penetration Testing Proof-of-Concept  

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept (PoC) script** designed for penetration testing and cybersecurity research. It leverages the **DigiKeyboard** library to simulate various security assessments, including file operations, encryption, Wi-Fi credential extraction, and program execution.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This script is intended **strictly for educational and ethical hacking purposes**. It should only be executed in controlled environments with **explicit authorization**. Any misuse of this script for unauthorized access, data tampering, or malicious intent is strictly prohibited. **The author assumes no responsibility for any consequences resulting from misuse.**  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🗑️ **File Operations** – Simulates file deletion and modification.  
- 🔒 **Encryption Demonstration** – Implements basic encryption using system commands.  
- 📶 **Wi-Fi Credential Extraction** – Retrieves and exports saved Wi-Fi profiles for security analysis.  
- 📨 **Automated Messaging** – Sends predefined messages to simulate potential phishing techniques.  
- 🔐 **Screen Lock Simulation** – Demonstrates unauthorized access prevention mechanisms.  
- ▶️ **Remote Execution Simulation** – Executes predefined programs to showcase script automation capabilities.  

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage  
1️⃣ **Install Dependencies**: Ensure the DigiKeyboard library is installed.  
2️⃣ **Secure Environment**: Test the script in an isolated or virtualized system.  
3️⃣ **Upload & Deploy**: Flash the script onto a compatible device (e.g., Digispark board).  
4️⃣ **Execution**: Connect the device to a test system and analyze the results.  

## 🔑 Ethical Guidelines  
✔️ Always obtain **explicit permission** before testing any system.  
✔️ Use this tool **only in legal, ethical penetration testing scenarios**.  
✔️ Follow cybersecurity best practices and **responsible disclosure policies**.  

🚀 **Stay Ethical, Stay Secure!** 🚀
