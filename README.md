# 🔐⚡ Penetration Testing Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
### Advanced Red-Team Automation Using DigiKeyboard

A high-impact PoC designed for **cybersecurity research**, **physical attack simulations**, and **ethical hacking**.  
This repository demonstrates how USB-based automation can trigger rapid payload execution, credential extraction, system manipulation, and security bypass simulations.

## 🚀 Features Overview

### 🗑️ 1. File System Manipulation  
Simulates malware-like file interactions, including:
- Creating files  
- Modifying contents  
- Deleting sensitive data  
Used for demonstrating weak endpoint security.

---

### 🔒 2. Encryption / Obfuscation Demo  
Executes encryption or obfuscation commands to show:
- How fast data can be manipulated  
- Why endpoint monitoring is essential  

---

### 📶 3. Wi-Fi Credential Extraction  
Automatically retrieves stored Wi-Fi passwords for:
- Security audits  
- Weak configuration assessments  
- Awareness training

---

### 📨 4. Automated Messaging Payloads  
Simulates:
- Phishing automation  
- Social engineering scripts  
- Message injection attacks  

---

### 🔐 5. Lock Screen & Access Prevention  
Demonstrates physical attack scenarios, such as:
- Instant screen lock  
- User disruption  
- Unauthorized access protection

---

### ▶️ 6. Remote Code Execution (RCE Simulation)  
Executes:
- Local programs  
- Scripts  
- Hidden payloads  
Useful for demonstrating privilege escalation or unattended execution risks.

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Deployment

### 🔧 1) Install Dependencies  
Ensure the **DigiKeyboard** library is installed in Arduino IDE:  
`Tools → Manage Libraries → Search "DigiKeyboard"`

### 💻 2) Flash the Code  
Upload the PoC to a **Digispark USB** or compatible device.

### 🧪 3) Always Use a Safe Lab  
Recommended:
- Virtual Machine (Windows 10/11)
- VMware or VirtualBox
- Host-only network
- Snapshots enabled

### ⚡ 4) Deploy the Payload  
Insert the device → Payload executes instantly and automatically.
